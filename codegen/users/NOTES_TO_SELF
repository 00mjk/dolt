HELLO TOMORROW SELF

I know you will have forgotten all of this, so I left you a note:

We are trying to generate strong Go types to make the code in /user easier to write, and to gain experience with how user code will eventually be strongly typed.

- next up is to write out the getter/setters for the fields in nomgen/nomgen.go
  - then generate the strongly-typed sets
  - then actually try to use it in the /user package

- i just realized i don't need the separation between the nomgen program and the mkdata program: nomgen should be a lib that user code (e.g., mkdata) links in. Then we also wouldn't need the file-based chunkstore as an intermediate place for the data to live between the two programs -- just a MemoryStore would do.

- fill in the flag details for the various programs
