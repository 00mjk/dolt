# Mission and Vision

*Noms mission is to enable the world's developers to build complex
decentralized applications.*

We believe that the biggest challenge faced by today's developers is
lack of a datastore appropriate for complex decentralized applications. Our vision
is to provide a database native to the decentralized web that
provides:

1. Efficient and correct multiparty sync and conflict resolution
1. Search across the entire network, including data that isn’t local
1. Paging of data from the network “lazily” as needed
1. Enforcement of business logic
1. Load-spreading to minimize hotspots
1. Data persistence: data should not lost when a node disconnects or goes away

This vision is achievable. Today Noms can do (1), (2), and (3). We
have ideas for how to solve (4).  Bittorrent and IPFS are existence
proofs for (5). We do not yet have a solution for (6), though there
are several promising efforts underway that may in the future provide
some of the tools we need (e.g., Filecoin).
